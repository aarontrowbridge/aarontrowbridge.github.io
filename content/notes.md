## Physics

### quantum gravity

* [gauge theory and quantum gravity](/notes/QG.pdf) (hand-written notes)
  * an overview of a quantum gravity -- focusing on the graviton propagator and developing the gauge theoretic formulation with the Chern-Simons action
  * these notes were used to give a blackboard lecture as a final project for graduate quantum field theory I at Syracuse University

* [an accelerated metropolis algorithm for lattice quantum gravity simulations](/notes/quantum_gravity_pres.pdf) (slides)
  * these beamer slides detail work I did on a novel version of the metropolis algorithm   
  * part of a talk given at an undergraduate research festival at Syracuse University
